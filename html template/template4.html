							<h1>  About Us</h1>
							<h4>Sample Headline</h4>
							<p>A paragraph is a section of a piece of writing. 
								A paragraph always begins on a new line and contains at least one sentence.
								The length of a paragraph depends on the information it conveys. 
								Paragraph 81 sets out the rules that should apply if a gift is accepted.

								The footer is located at the bottom of the Web page and is coded using the appropriate 
								"footer" HTML or "#footer" CSS tags. It is treated like a section, similarly to the header 
								or body content, and uses the same coding as those sections. The footer is often coded to 
								be the same width as the webpage content section, but the height varies from website to website.
